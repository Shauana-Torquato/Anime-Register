<h1>Anime Register</h1> 
<p>This is a personal microproject to learn JAVA basing on something that will be useful to me as User as well. I do watch animes and I have many that I already watched and that I want to watch someday. So this microproject is exactly to create a program that allows me to register my Animes and put there the informations that are relevant to me as an Anime fan, making possible for me to manage my animes</p>
</br>
<ul>
 <li>JAVA, Gradle</li></br>
 <li>System to enroll animes with the functions: add anime, list all, list the ones I watched, List the ones I want to Watch, quit</li></br>
 <li>The "add" function must to require for: 
 <ol> </br>
   <li>name of the anime</li></br>
   <li>genre</li></br>
   <li>if already watched it or not</li></br>
   <li>if it is a concluded anime or not - status</li></br>
   <li>year</li></br>
   <li>episodes</li></br>
   <li>synopse</li></br>
   <li>personal review</li></br>
   <li>personal rate to the anime</li></br>
 </ol></li></br>
 <li>If the anime gets 'yes' to "watched' it must go to 'I already watched it' list, if it gets a 'no', it goes to 'I want to watch it' list </li></br>
 <li>If the anime gets a 'yes' to the 'concluded' question, it needs to show 'concluded' as status, if it gets 'no', the status needs to be 'on going'</li></br>
  <li>The lists must show only the name of the anime</li></br>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Fix where I misspelled 'gender" for 'genre', the anime genre, not the anime gender</li></br>
 <li>Work on the graphic interface</li></br>
 <li>Implement the percistance of the data in this system/code</li></br>
 <li>Make the names on the lists that are presented to be clickable</li></br>
 <li>Make that whenever the name of the anime get clicked, it shows the other information that were enrolled on the add step</li></br>
 <li>Implement the 'delete anime' and 'edit anime' functions</li></br>
</ol>

<h2>Work on Progress - Folder</h2>

<p>This is a folder created to work on files separated from the main project folder, I'm a beginner and I fear screwing up the project so I usually work with a folder that has everything that is working just fine, a folder that goes with what I'm elaborating "new", and I work with both aspects together on the environment (I'm using the Apache NetBeans IDE 23 in this case), so later on I will update the third folder, which is the result on the IDE from the initial that is already working + work on progress. This is a measure that helps me to get more calm and have better control over my learning journey and makes me feel more comfortable about making mistakes (by knowing I have some sort of backup and isolation of files to track the error)</p>
</br>
<p><strong>What I've been working on right now:</strong></p>
</br>
<ul>
 <li>creation and implementation of Class AnimeDAO to provide and implement the percistence</li></br>
 <li>creation and implementation of the Class Anime View to show the data</li></br>
 <li>creation and implementation  of the Class AnimeGUI to manage the graphics interface</li></br>
 <li><strong>the MVC Architeture is being implemented</strong></li></br>
 <li><strong>next: criation of animeController and work on the data bank itself</strong></li></br>
</ul>
