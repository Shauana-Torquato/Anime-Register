<h1>Anime Register</h1> 
<p>This is a personal microproject to learn JAVA basing on something that will be useful to me as User as well. I do watch animes and I have many that I already watched and that I want to watch someday. So this microproject is exactly to create a program that allows me to register my Animes and put there the informations that are relevant to me as an Anime fan, making possible for me to manage my animes</p>
</br>
<ul>
 <li>JAVA, Gradle</li></br>
 <li>System to enroll animes with the functions: add anime, list all, list the ones I watched, List the ones I want to Watch, quit</li></br>
 <li>The "add" function must to require for: 
 <ol>
   <li>name of the anime</li></br>
   <li>genre</li></br>
   <li>if already watched it or not</li></br>
   <li>if it is a concluded anime or not - status</li></br>
   <li>year</li></br>
   <li>episodes</li></br>
   <li>synopse</li></br>
   <li>personal review</li></br>
   <li>personal rate to the anime</li></br>
 </ol></li></br>
 <li>If the anime gets 'yes' to "watched' it must go to 'I already watched it' list, if it gets a 'no', it goes to 'I want to watch it' list </li></br>
 <li>If the anime gets a 'yes' to the 'concluded' question, it needs to show 'concluded' as status, if it gets 'no', the status needs to be 'on going'</li></br>
  <li>The lists must show only the name of the anime</li></br>
</ul>
